# XOX_2D
2D Tic Tac Toe in Unity.


It is simple project to gradually get into world of game development. So far so good. My journey until now:
### First week
- Creating a project
- Adding a background
- Making first C# script to change sprite and properties of the background on key click
- Finding out good enough assets to use in the future
- Deciding on the methods to use
</links>

### Second week
- Fighting with proper placement of the planet
- Trying out different methods and making them move using Update() function and math's sin() and cos()
- Figuring out how to calculate right angle to spawn planet outside of vidible area (Acos()) - very nerve breaking
- Testing if they are working well
- First attempts of grid generation
</links>

### Third week
- Adding buttons to make menu for players
- Trying out to use global variables for settings
- Implementing GameManager, slider to set-up grid size
- Upgrading grid generator and tile actions as placing X's and O's
</links>

### Fourth week
- A little break due to easter üê£ holidays!
- Slowly implementing logic to check if placing X or O was a winning move for a player
- Considered refactoring GridManager to static class for better practice (like in GameManager)
